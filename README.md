## Overview
This project aims to comprehensively explore and analyze electricity consumption patterns in India. It investigates various factors influencing electricity usage, regional disparities, and future consumption forecasts. By understanding these factors, we can manage demand, promote sustainable practices, and assess the effectiveness of policy reforms, renewable energy initiatives, and rural electrification efforts.

## Dataset
The data was collected from the Power System Operation Corporation Limited (POSOCO), a Government of India enterprise. Electricity consumption data for every state was grouped into five regions: North, South, East, West, and Northeastern. Comparative studies were conducted on energy consumption across regions, correlation analysis, and density plots for specific comparisons.

## Methodology
The project employs the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) model and the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Variables (SARIMAX) model for forecasting. Results were obtained for each region, showing varying levels of accuracy. 

## Evaluation and Interpretation
The forecasted results were compared with the actual data to assess the accuracy of the models. Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and forecast error were calculated to quantify the model's performance. The interpretation of the forecasted results was done in the context of regional trends, seasonality, and the influence of exogenous variables.
